DUALIST: Utility for Active Learning with Instances and Semantic Terms
======================================================================

Version 02 - 03/08/2012
-----------------------

* BUG FIX: Updates to dualist.tui.Util and dualist.tui.Test that fix a bug in
  testing post-hoc trained models, in the event that the training and test
  labels are presented in a different order. (Submitted by Stef Sch)


Version 02 - 02/10/2012
-----------------------

* BUG FIX: Gracefully processes non-ASCII characters.

* BUG FIX: TwitterPipe no longer ignores text after a @USERLINK.

* BUG FIX: Handles small toy data sets now.

* Separated code into "core" and "gui" components. Core implements the 
  machine learning business logic, whereas GUI implements the Web-based
  interactive interface. As a result, DUALIST now requires a build (using ant) 
  after any changes to core.

* Created a more user-friendly script "dualist" to run commands.

* Models are now saved in the "models/" directory, indexed by trial name and 
  timestamp. These models can be evaluated offline on totally separate test
  data, or used to classify other large data sets.
